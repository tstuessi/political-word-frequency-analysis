# Political Word Frequency Analysis
Politicians push a ton of rhetoric towards the average voter, and sometimes it is hard to tell what is actually being focused on by each candidate. In the first part of this project, I attempt to use word frequency analysis to distinguish between the focus of our two presidential candidates. I am using their respective "Issues" pages as my corpus to analyze. In the second part, I attempt to use word frequency analysis to compare two of Hillary's respective speeches that seem to focus on economic policy.
## Comparing Hillary to Trump
In the presidential race, the key differentiators between the candidates are their positions on many different issues. On each candidate's website they have a page dedicated to a summary of their positions on a variety of issues, but they also have pages dedicated to expanded discussions of each issue. I am going to use text analysis to determine the most popular words used by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their respective issue descriptions, and I am going to compare them.
## Comparing Hillary to Hillary
Luckily, Hillary keeps records of all of the speeches she gives at public events, so it is fairly easy to find speeches on the same general topic to compare. In this part, I attempt to use word frequency analysis to compare two of her speeches, found at the links below:
